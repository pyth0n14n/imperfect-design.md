The list below is compiled to inform, guide, and inspire budding security researchers. Oh and to pick something for bedtime reading too.

Included in the list are works on the following topics related to MCU/SoC security:

* Secure boot
* Fault injection
* Side channel attacks

At the end of the list, there is also a section with links to articles of potential general interest, not addressing vulnerabilities in any specific device.
